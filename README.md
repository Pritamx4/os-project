# Memory Management Simulator

A modern, interactive web-based simulator for visualizing memory management techniques including **Paging**, **Virtual Memory**, and **Segmentation**.

## 🎨 Features

- **Paging Simulation**
  - FIFO (First In First Out) algorithm
  - LRU (Least Recently Used) algorithm
  - Visual frame state tracking
  - Real-time statistics (Page Faults, Hits, Hit Rate)
  - Step-by-step execution timeline

- **Segmentation**
  - Segment table visualization
  - Address translation with validation
  - Physical memory map
  - Segmentation fault detection

- **Modern UI**
  - High-contrast black theme
  - Professional typography (Inter & JetBrains Mono)
  - Smooth animations and transitions
  - Responsive design
  - Enhanced input fields and dropdowns

## 🚀 Quick Start

Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser. No installation or build process required!

## 💻 Usage

### Paging Mode
1. Select your preferred algorithm (FIFO or LRU)
2. Set the number of frames
3. Enter a page reference string (comma-separated numbers)
4. Click "Run Simulation" to see the results
5. View the execution timeline and statistics

### Segmentation Mode
1. Switch to Segmentation mode
2. View the segment table
3. Enter segment number and offset
4. See the physical address translation or segmentation fault

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Pure HTML5
- CSS3 (with modern gradients, animations, and shadows)
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Google Fonts (Inter & JetBrains Mono)

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

- **High Contrast Black Theme**: For reduced eye strain and professional appearance
- **Premium Typography**: Using Inter for UI and JetBrains Mono for technical data
- **Smooth Interactions**: Cubic-bezier animations for professional feel
- **Accessible**: Clear labels, good contrast, and logical flow
